## Description
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Log

### Day 1
I've missed working on files. :)

### Day 2
Easier than day 1 to be honest. :/

### Day 3
Oof this one was hard. :(

### Day 4
Ok. Ignore the amount of if statements with repeated code, I did not want the worlds' longest if statement full of ands and ors. ;(

### Day 5
I forgot how much Python arrays suck when you try making a 2d array full of a set value. But part 1 seemed harder than it was thankfully.
